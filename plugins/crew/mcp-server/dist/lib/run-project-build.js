/**
 * `runProjectBuild` — Story 8.17.
 *
 * The pre-PR build gate's runner. `runDevTerminalAction` calls this AFTER the
 * dev's commit but BEFORE `gh pr create`, so a red build blocks the PR from ever
 * being opened (the #211 failure class — a story broke an untouched sibling file,
 * its story-scoped vitest passed in isolation, and a red PR was opened).
 *
 * The command and its working directory are DERIVED here, in one place, so the
 * derivation is assertable in a test and a future refactor cannot silently narrow
 * the gate to a partial / story-scoped build:
 *
 *   - command: `pnpm build` — the project's full build, i.e. the same command CI
 *     runs (.github/workflows/ci.yml `- run: pnpm build`, which fans out to
 *     `pnpm -r build` → `tsc -p tsconfig.json && node scripts/normalise-dist.mjs`
 *     for the mcp-server). This is a WHOLE-PROJECT type-check, not a subset, so it
 *     catches breakage in files the story did not touch.
 *   - cwd: `<devWorkingDir>/plugins/crew` — derived from the dev's working
 *     directory (the worktree when Story 8.16 isolation is on, else
 *     `targetRepoRoot`), matching CI's `working-directory: plugins/crew`. Pinning
 *     it to the dev's working directory is what makes the gate catch cross-file
 *     breakage the dev introduced, and lets this story compose with 8.16 in either
 *     order.
 *
 * The build is spawned through the SAME `execa` injection seam the rest of
 * `runDevTerminalAction` already uses (no second spawn mechanism), so the vitest
 * can stub it to simulate a passing / failing build without spawning a real one.
