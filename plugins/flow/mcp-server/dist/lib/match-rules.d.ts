/**
 * `matchRule` — three-signal AND-combination rule matcher for risk-tier classification.
 *
 * Story 4.9b — Pattern §11, AND-combination semantics.
 *
 * A rule matches when EVERY declared signal field on it matches the diff:
 * - `path_patterns`: if present, AT LEAST ONE `changedPaths` entry matches
 *   AT LEAST ONE pattern (via `picomatch` with default options). With
 *   `all_paths_match: true`, instead EVERY changed file must match a pattern
 *   (and there must be ≥1) — the conservative low-tier semantic.
 * - `change_types`: if present, AT LEAST ONE detected change type appears
 *   in the rule's array.
 * - `diff_size_thresholds`: if present, `diffSize` satisfies the bounds
 *   (`min_lines_changed ≤ diffSize ≤ max_lines_changed`, with absent bounds
 *   treated as -∞ and +∞ respectively).
 * - `additive_only`: if `true`, the PR's diff must be additive-only (every
 *   changed file is a new-file addition — `ctx.additiveOnly`).
 * - `path_excludes`: subtractive guard — if ANY changed file matches any of
 *   these globs, the rule does NOT match, regardless of its positive signals.
 *
 * Absent signal fields are "not declared" and do NOT constrain the match.
 * Story 4.9's schema guarantees every rule declares at least one signal, so
 * the all-absent case is unreachable in production.
